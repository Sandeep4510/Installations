#What's here for you

Error : Access denied error when trying to paste create files in one of the partition[Harddisk] of the Linux.

**Make sure you have mounted the storage device.

Reason : We have to have permission to write [ create/paste new files ]. Since we do not have the permission we are getting this error.

            
Solutions : 
           The Error message shows the path of the partition - add the path to chmod command
           Open terminal and type 
           "sudo chmod 777 /the/path/that/shows/in/the/error/message"
           Followed by root password.
